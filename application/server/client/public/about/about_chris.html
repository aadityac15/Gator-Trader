           <p style="text-align:center">Hi! My name is Christopher Smith. I'm a senior computer science
					student at San Francisco State University. Although I started as
					an engineering major, working in databases with the College of
					Science and Engineering	showed me all the possibilities a career
					in computer science could offer. After that, the switch was easy.
					I now spend my time polishing my coding skills, writing applications
					and playing video games. I'm also an experienced game developer with
					a couple finished titles under my belt.
